\
understood as reconstruction of existing disciplines through computation creating performativity, efficiency, ease of access, digital skills, etc.\
technical endeavor \
\
tended to be associated with information literacy and digital literacy: learning a digital skill\
\
we should also be thinking about what critical approaches should mean in a computational age\
\
crisis in humanities corresponding to rise in \'93digital humanities\'94\
\
relatively new as term (~ 2001)\
\
building archives, infrastructure and digital tools for humanists to undertake research\
\
dichotomy between humanities and technical: certain activities rewarded as academic (monographs) and others as technical (tools, archives)\
\
Ramsay (2013) identified 2 types:\
	1. as archives/tools; united by set of practices; coding required to be called DH\
	2. more expansive notion incl. media theory, cultural critique\
\
McCarty (2003) conceptualises as a concern with the methodological commons\
\
Current definitions of Digital Humanities leave the research questions for DH to be defined elsewhere\
\

\
Berry (2011): three waves in DH\
	1. computing in the humanities, archives and tools ( -2001)\
	2. interfaces and the born digital (2002-2009)\
	3. materiality and cultural critique \
\
Alan Liu (2011): thinking critically about metadata (\'85) scales into thinking critically about the power, finance, and other governance protocols of the world\
\
# Iteracy\
\
make the digital humanities a humanities discipline: import the critical \
